## A

**Absolute beginner**: Someone who has never encountered concepts or material before. The term is used in distinction to false beginner.

**Active learning**: An approach to instruction in which
learners engage with material through discussion, problem solving, case studies,
and other activities that require them to reflect on and use new information in
real time.  See also passive-learningpassive learning.

**Active teaching**: An approach to instruction in which the
teacher acts on new information acquired from learners while teaching (e.g.\ by
dynamically changing an example or rearranging the intended order of content).
See also passive-teachingpassive teaching.

**Authentic task**: A task which contains important
elements of things that learners would do in real (non-classroom situations). To
be authentic, a task should require learners to construct their own answers
rather than choose between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and
data they would use in real life.

**Automaticity**: The ability to do a task without concentrating on its low-level details.

## B

**Backward design**: An instructional design method that
works backwards from a summative assessment to formative assessments and thence
to lesson content.

**Behaviorism**: A theory of learning whose central principle
is stimulus and response, and whose goal is to explain behavior without recourse
to internal mental states or other unobservables. See
also cognitivismcognitivism.

**Bloom's Taxonomy**: A six-part hierarchical
classification of understanding whose levels are _knowledge_,
_comprehension_, _application_, _analysis_, _synthesis_, and

computing concepts using non-programming examples and artifacts.

**CS0**: An introductory college-level course on computing aimed at
non-majors with little or no prior experience of programming.
