<h2>A</h2>
<p>Absolute beginner: Someone who has never encountered concepts or material before. The term is used in distinction to false beginner.</p>
<p>Active learning: An approach to instruction in which learners engage with material through discussion, problem solving, case studies, and other activities that require them to reflect on and use new information in real time. See also passive-learningpassive learning.</p>
<p>Active teaching: An approach to instruction in which the teacher acts on new information acquired from learners while teaching (e.g. by dynamically changing an example or rearranging the intended order of content). See also passive-teachingpassive teaching.</p>
<p>Authentic task: A task which contains important elements of things that learners would do in real (non-classroom situations). To be authentic, a task should require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data they would use in real life.</p>
<p>Automaticity: The ability to do a task without concentrating on its low-level details.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-b" class="section level2">
<h2>B</h2>
<p>Backward design: An instructional design method that works backwards from a summative assessment to formative assessments and thence to lesson content.</p>

<p>Concept map A picture of a mental model in which concepts are nodes in a graph and relationships are (labeled) arcs.</p>
<p>Connectivism A theory of learning that holds that knowledge is distributed, that learning is the process of navigating, growing, and pruning connections, and which emphasizes the social aspects of learning made possible by the internet.</p>
<p>Constructivism A theory of learning that views learners as actively constructing knowledge.</p>
<p>Content knowledge A person’s understanding of a subject. See also general-pedagogical-knowledgegeneral pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical-content-knowledgepedagogical content knowledge.</p>

<p>cs-unpluggedCS Unplugged A style of teaching that introduces computing concepts using non-programming examples and artifacts.</p>
<p>cs0CS0 An introductory college-level course on computing aimed at non-majors with little or no prior experience of programming.</p>
