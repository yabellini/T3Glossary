<h2>A</h2>
<p><strong>Absolute beginner</strong>: Someone who has never encountered concepts or material before. The term is used in distinction to false beginner.</p>
<p><strong>Active learning</strong>: An approach to instruction in which learners engage with material through discussion, problem solving, case studies, and other activities that require them to reflect on and use new information in real time. See also passive-learningpassive learning.</p>
<p><strong>Active teaching</strong>: An approach to instruction in which the teacher acts on new information acquired from learners while teaching (e.g. by dynamically changing an example or rearranging the intended order of content). See also passive-teachingpassive teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Authentic task</strong>: A task which contains important elements of things that learners would do in real (non-classroom situations). To be authentic, a task should require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data they would use in real life.</p>
